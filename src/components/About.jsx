        <p className='text-white mt-6 mx-10'>Hi, I'm Kylie Lallak, a computer science student from Mahtomedi, Minnesota. I began my journey at UC Davis in the fall of 2022 with a passion for problem-solving and using technology to create solutions that make a real difference. My main focus is on web development, where Iâ€™m continually sharpening my skills. Outside of coding, I love bouldering, playing volleyball, and expressing creativity through arts and crafts.</p>
